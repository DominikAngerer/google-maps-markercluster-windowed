# Google Maps MarkerCluster - Windowed

This repository and npm module only encapsulates the original script into a window variable so it can be used directly with TS loaded via 'shim', and doesn't modify it's source.

## How to use

### bower
```
bower install google-maps-markercluster-windowed
```
